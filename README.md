## about dataset
The "OCD Patient Dataset: Demographics & Clinical Data" is a comprehensive collection of information
pertaining to 1500 individuals diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). This dataset
encompasses a wide range of parameters, providing a detailed insight into the demographic and clinical
profiles of these individuals.
Included in this dataset are key demographic details such as age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and
education level, offering a comprehensive overview of the sample population. Additionally, clinical
information like the date of OCD diagnosis, duration of symptoms, and any previous psychiatric diagnoses
are recorded, providing context to the patients' journeys.
The dataset also delves into the specific nature of OCD symptoms, categorizing them into obsession and
compulsion types. Severity of these symptoms is assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive
Scale (Y-BOCS) scores for both obsessions and compulsions. Furthermore, it documents any co-occurring
mental health conditions, including depression and anxiety diagnoses.
